# Streamlit Chatbot using Ollama Open Source LLMs

The codebase has code for building Chatbot using the Streamlit Python library. For accessing LLMs, it uses the Ollama Python library which is a wrapper around Ollama REST APIs.

Ollama is a CLI tool that lets us run open-source LLMs on our computers for free.

Feel free to check the below video to understand the code and set up Chatbot on your computer.
